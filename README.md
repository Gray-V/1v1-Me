# 1v1-Me

Two players spawn in an arena on opposite ends, and 3d shapes drop down from the sky to act as cover. The players goal is to be the last one standing and kill the other player. They do this with sword melee combat with intuitive reactive combat. This combat is rewarding less for thinking about it and more for primal response to game feedback (camera shakes, blood, vfx, sound). I want to have fun movement like glide jumps and uppercuts into in air combos as well as have the floor be slightly slippery so you can build up momentem. I will be getting all assets online
